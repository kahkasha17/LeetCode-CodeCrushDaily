## 🧑‍💻 How to Use?

Welcome to this LeetCode Solutions repository! Here’s a quick guide to help you get started with viewing and using the code solutions effectively:

- 📁 **Explore the Repository Structure:**
        The solutions are organized by folders for each question range (e.g., 0000-0099), making it easy to find specific problems.
        Each folder contains subfolders for individual questions, named by the question number and title (e.g., 0001-TwoSum).
        Inside each question folder, there’s a solution.md file with explanations and code for that specific problem.
- 🔍 **Navigate to Specific Problems:**
        Go to the "Solutions" folder, and select the range folder that includes the question you’re looking for.
        Open the subfolder with the question number and title to view the solution file.

        In each solution.md file, you’ll find:
        A description of the problem, including the prompt and requirements.
        A detailed solution explanation, which covers the approach and thought process behind the code.
        Code implementation in a readable format to help you tackle similar problems.
- 🛠️ **Using Code for Practice:**
        Feel free to copy the code and test it on LeetCode’s platform.
        Experiment by modifying the code to deepen your understanding and explore alternative solutions.
