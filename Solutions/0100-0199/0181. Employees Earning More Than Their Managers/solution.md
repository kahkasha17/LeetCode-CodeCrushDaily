## Solutions

### Solution 1: Self-Join + Conditional Filtering

We can find employees' salaries and their managers' salaries by self-joining the `Employee` table, then filter out employees whose salaries are higher than their managers' salaries.

#### MySQL

```sql
# Write your MySQL query statement below
SELECT e1.name Employee
FROM
    Employee e1
    JOIN Employee e2 ON e1.managerId = e2.id
WHERE e1.salary > e2.salary;
```
